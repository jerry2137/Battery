In this project, I used FNN to predict the SOC of Li-ion Battary.
I first started with the data processed (Normalized, Resampled, Noise Canceled) by other researchers, and with many different algorithms (RNN, FNN, SVM) and structures.
After getting a satisfying result, I moved on to the raw data. The way to find the proper data processing algorithm was hard, but the finally worked.
